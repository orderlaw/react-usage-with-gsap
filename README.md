Simple example of using GSAP with React.js

still let's discuss these topics a lil bit....

so GSAP is a great js library that helps you animating stuffs easily and efficiently...

prerequisite-
1) Good knowledge of Javascript
2) Getting help with GSAP for animations for a website is good... but you should also know css animation, thou you don't need em while using GSAP, but it's better to be knowledgeable about everything, learn css basics and animations
3) Ofc you'll need React.js for this
4) GSAP basics

That's it... if you fulfil all the prerequisites u can get started... but if you don't, learning them first would be beneficial!
